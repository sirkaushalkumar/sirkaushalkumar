### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am **Kaushal Kumar**. I am currently working as a Technical Specialist at Sony India Software Centre Private Limited. 

I love reading content on Internet and watch Netflix Shows in free time. I spend a lot of time listening music.

I am a Mechanical Engineer by education, a Mathematics Enthusiast by choice and IT Executive by profession. 

As they say, I am also a hard-edged, sanguine, sapiosexual, antihero, who is tortured by his own demons. 

I am also writing to inform that I do have an affinity to learn and would be more than happy to learn and collaborate with you. Thanks for stopping by.

I remian with thanks and regards <br/>
_Kaushal Kumar (Professor Pandit)_
